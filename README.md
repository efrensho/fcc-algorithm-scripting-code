# My FreeCodeCamp Algorithm Scripting Code

This repo is planned to function as a journal where I will keep track of my own solutions to the *Algorithm Scripting* challenges for the *Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification* from freeCodeCamp.

I will upload each solution commented just to have a journal for maybe future references of my work through the curriculum.

Solutions for:

- Basic Algorithm Scripting
- Intermediate Algorithm Scripting
